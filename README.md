## Crazy-Kittens - The Game

Crazy-Kittens is a turn-based card game where the goal of the game is to stay in
the game: A player leaves the game when he or she draws a Crazy Kitten card but
does not have a Defuse Kitten card to counter the Crazy Kitten.

The actions associated with every card increase the difficulty of the game. For
example, playing two non-action cards simultaneously allows the player to steal
a card, hopefully the Defuse card, from the opponent. Another powerful card is
the Nope card which allows the player to 'Nope' or cancel an action card played
by the opponent. For instance, your opponent has played two non-action cards and
is now trying to steal on of your cards. You can use the Nope card to prevent
that.

## Crazy-Kittens - The Rules

At the beginning of the game, every player receives a total of 5 cards: 4 action
cards and 1 defuse card. The Crazy Kitten cards and the remaining cards are
going to be shuffled to create the Draw Pile. So the only way for a player to
get a Crazy Kitten is by drawing it from the Draw Pile.

Then the first player begins their turn. Every turn consists of 2 phases:
During the first phase the player chooses which card to play from their hand.
After the player has played from their hand, the player places the played cards
onto the Discard Pile and finishes their turn by drawing one card from the Draw
Pile which concludes the second phase of their turn.

Because every player has to draw a new card at the end of their turn, the game
continues until all but one player get terminated by having drawn, and failed to
defuse, a Crazy Kitten.
